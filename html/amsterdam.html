            <p>One of Amsterdam's most popular attractions — and certainly its most important art repository — the Rijksmuseum (National Museum) was founded in 1798 to house the country's huge collection of rare art and antiquities. The museum's impressive collection includes a million cultural artifacts dating from the 13th century to the modern day, among them more than 8,000 important paintings spread across 250 rooms of this sprawling building.

            In addition to its paintings, the Rijksmuseum boasts a well-stocked library of more than 35,000 books and manuscripts, as well as numerous fascinating displays dealing with the development of art and culture in the Netherlands. Of special note are its collections of traditional handicrafts, medieval sculpture, and modern art styles.</p>
            <li>Jordan Neighbourhood</li>

            <p>Jordaan is the most popular of Amsterdam's neighborhoods and is well-known for its mix of residential areas with garden courtyards, lively markets, and upscale boutiques and eateries. The area is also home to plenty of fun things to do, from taking a pleasant stroll along the many picturesque streets to spending time visiting the many top-rated tourist attractions located here.

            Although best known as the location of Anne Frank House, the area is also home to lesser-known treasures like the Woonboots Museum, a floating museum dedicated to houseboats, and the interesting (honestly!) Amsterdam Cheese Museum.

            On Saturday mornings, Lindengracht turns into a huge open-air market, where you can find local crafts, produce, flowers, and goodies perfect for filling a picnic basket. Monday mornings, it is Westerstraat that fills with 200 vendors' stalls, this time selling a wide range of goods in a flea-market-style bazaar. Jordaan's restaurants and cafés have become the trendy place to sit and people-watch while enjoying traditional Dutch folk music</p>

            <p>Formerly the Town Hall, the Royal Palace of Amsterdam (Koninklijk Paleis van Amsterdam) serves as the King's residence when he's in the city. Its construction was a monumental task when started in 1648 and required the sinking of 13,659 piles to support the mammoth structure.

            Based upon the architecture of ancient Rome, the exterior is strictly classical, while the interior is magnificently furnished, its apartments decorated with a wealth of reliefs, ornamentation, marble sculptures, and friezes. Check out the spectacular ceiling paintings by Ferdinand Bol and Govert Flinck, pupils of Rembrandt.

            Other highlights include one of the finest furniture collections in the world, and the City Treasurer's room with its marble fireplace and ceiling paintings by Cornelis Holsteyn. You'll also see the Hall of the Aldermen, also containing paintings by Bol and Flinck.

            The largest and most important room is the Council Hall, sumptuously decorated and one of the most beautiful staterooms in Europe. English language guided tours are</p>
            <li>West Church</li>
            <img src="https://www.gpsmycity.com/img/gd_attr/6436.jpg">
            <p>West Church (Westerkerk) is one of the most popular churches to visit in the city. It's certainly one of the most picturesque.

            Completed in 1630, this attractive Renaissance church is unusual due to its many internal and external Gothic features. Its 85-meter tower, popularly known as "Langer Jan" (tall John), is the highest in the city. On the tip of its spire is a large replica of the emperor's crown, placed there in memory of Emperor Maximilian of Austria. Inside the tower, a carillon proclaims the hours.

            Other highlights include a fine organ dating from 1622, along with an interesting marble column placed here in 1906 in memory of Rembrandt. The great artist was originally buried outside the church, but was later reinterred inside. A gift shop is located on-site.
