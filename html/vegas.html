               <p>The 2.5-mile-long central section of Las Vegas Boulevard, which runs through the city from northeast to southwest, known as the Strip, is where the action is. Lined with huge entertainment palaces, many built with a defining theme, and home to performance venues, luxury hotel rooms, and fine dining, this is what most people think of when they picture Las Vegas.

                  One of the must-do's in Las Vegas is walking along the Strip and soaking up the sights. It's particularly impressive at night, when the city is illuminated by an endless succession of glittering neon signs. This area is a never-ending feast for the senses.

                  Generally speaking, the Las Vegas Strip runs from the Mandalay Bay Hotel to Treasure Island Hotel. </p>
               <li>Fermont Street</li>

               <p>In old downtown Las Vegas, Fremont Street is a pedestrian-only area with all kinds of unique sites. A five-block section of Fremont Street is covered over with a canopy of LED lights that illuminate the sky in a spectacle of different colors and designs as you walk below.

                  Known as the Fremont Street Experience, each night a fantastic music and visual show takes place overhead. Street performers and special entertainment acts often perform outdoors in this area. Fremont Street is in downtown Las Vegas, a few kilometers from the Strip.

                  It is best to take a taxi to reach this area. Or, if you want to truly experience the city at night, take a Las Vegas Strip Helicopter Night Flight ride above the city. Note that hotel pickup is optional on this tour.</p>
               <li>Bellagio Resort and Fountain show</li>

               <p>The Bellagio Resort in Las Vegas is a massive, high-end hotel complex, with a wide variety of attractions, including the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art, the Conservatory & Botanical Gardens, a spa and salon, and some of the finest restaurants in Las Vegas.

                  Beyond the lobby is a showroom area with changing themes that range from spring botanical displays to fascinating shows of art. The most impressive and famous feature is the fountain show.

                  In front of the Bellagio, along the Strip, the dancing fountains perform a beautiful display of water set to music. From the sidewalk, visitors have a ringside view. This is often described as the best free attraction in Las Vegas.Address: 3600 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas</p>
               <li>Caesar's Palace and The Colosseum</li>
               <img src="https://pix8.agoda.net/hotelImages/5112/-1/fe9015ba17cc4ca1e6da65483ab67414.jpg?ca=11&ce=1&s=1024x768">
               <p>Perhaps one of the best known of all the Las Vegas hotel resorts, Caesar's Palace continues to evolve. Currently Caesar's Palace is a massive complex in the middle of the Strip, complete with every imaginable entertainment option.

                  The hotel is closely associated with shows held in its huge concert venue known as "The Colosseum." Top performers (which have included Celine Dion and Elton John) perform here for extended periods, and shows are often booked out well in advance. Visitors planning a trip and hoping to see a performance here will want to check out dates and ticket availability as early as possible.
